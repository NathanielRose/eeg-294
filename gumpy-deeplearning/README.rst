Deep Learning models for Brain Computer Interfaces
=================================================

This repository contains deep learning models that can be used to decode EEG and
EEG signals for brain computer interfaces (BCIs). Some of the models depend on
the functionality that is provided by ``gumpy``, a python toolbox which contains
several signal and feature processing routines that are commonly used for BCIs.

Documentation
=============

You can find additional documentation for gumpy on www.gumpy.org.


Contributing
============

If you wish to contribute to gumpy's development clone one of gumpy's repository
from github and start coding, test if everything works as expected, and finally
submit patches or open merge requests. Preferrably in this order.

Please make sure that you follow PEP8, or have a look at the formatting of
gumpy's code, and include proper documentation both in your commit messages as
well as the source code. We use Google docstrings for formatting, and
auto-generate parts of the documentation with sphinx.
